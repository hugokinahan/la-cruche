            In what we hope to be the first of many La Cruche Tour Tips, members
            go head-to-head with a Win and E/W pick for the WGC Match Play this
            weekend in Austin, Texas. Using SkyBet prices and places
            requirements, returns will be tallied and added to a leaderboard.
          </p>

              While the La Cruche trophy remains the most coveted prize in
              sport, thereâ€™ll certainly be bragging rights for those who can
              return a tidy profit from their best bets throughout the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without further ado, the members have had their say and have gone
              with the following bets:
            </p>
            <img src={WGCtips} alt='tips' />
            <p>One point will be placed on each bet, while E/W winnings will NOT be split between those who exit at the quarter final stage.
