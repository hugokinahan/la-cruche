            La Cruche’s inaugural tour along the North Coast epitomised
            everything about what makes golf in Northern Ireland great:
            reasonable green fees, 40m/hr winds, horizontal rain, stunning views
            and a 19th hole full of Guinness. Golf here is tough.

            <p>
              Members Rhodes and Mellor arrived at Belfast Intl. early in the
              day, so Hugo and I thought it best to play a warm-up 18. With
              Rhodes due to leave us on Saturday- he had a family engagement, La
              Cruche does not operate a cutting system- he’d miss the weekend,
              so these swings counted. Carding 20pts at The Hilton sent a
              message to the rest of the field- Rhodes would be teeing off at
              Portrush tomorrow with the Marigold vest on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The remaining 4 members touched down that evening and with a
              hybrid-loss-scare thankfully resolved at the airport we were
              northbound to Ballycastle, our base for the week. Excitement
              filled the air as there finally existed an environment where golf
              could be discussed in depth without the judgement of others and
              the focus quickly shifted to the matter at hand- Sweaty Balls (see
              rules).

              Youngy, Mellor, Fitz and I had the pleasure of being the second
              fourball. It was only right that the brainchild of La Cruche be
              the one to hit the first official drive of the tournament. Not the
              longest hitter on tour but with the 1st hole at 349 yards, size
              didn’t matter. Hugo ushered one down the right and his tournament
              was underway. Conversely if memory serves me right, Rees
              (henceforth referred to as the GOAT) had the misfortune of hitting
              his drive- also his Sweaty Ball- OB right. The only way was up for
              the GOAT, and up he went.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were plotting our way very nicely around a golf course which,
              considering its status as Dunluce Links’ younger and less
              attractive brother, still holds up. Out in 17pts, I was having one
              of those rounds were keeping quiet is the only way to prevent the
              Golfing Gods from reminding you why their sport is capable of
              giving you an aneurysm. While Storm Ellen was intensifying the
              further we got from the clubhouse, a maintenance hut above the
              10th green was appropriate shelter until it wasn’t- and like that
              Ellen’s clouds burst. Youngy didn’t lose many balls that afternoon
              but he did lose his umbrella- I like to think it’s made a new
              start somewhere in the Hebrides, Jura perhaps. As the rain lashed
              down, we found more robust shelter under the driving range roof
              and all 8 of us tried to remove our waterproofs and dry out our
              gloves and grips.

              One of the green-keepers must have taken pity on us- perhaps
              because he’d been tailing us for 3 holes and hadn’t seen a single
              GIR or perhaps because we were literally soaked to the bone- and
              offered us use of the many baskets of range balls (Titleist ProV1s
              no less- yes it did host The Open and yes McIlroy did miss the
              cut). Retrospectively, those 20 minutes spent together watching
              Fitz hit his SIM off the deck, discussing the course’s irrigation
              and surprising green speeds while freezing cold and soaked to the
              bone were the highlight of the trip for me. At the time it seemed
              a ‘snapshot’ moment but 8 months later it seems even more-so. The
              Golfing Gods rewarded our resolve as Ellen pushed West to annoy
              some other golfers, leaving behind crystal clear skies and some
              glorious late afternoon sunshine.

              The wind and the rain might have impacted the scorecards up to the
              11th hole, but the soft greens left behind by Ellen gave both
              groups an opportunity to score some points. We averaged 25pts as a
              group which I think is extremely impressive. After we’d done our
              best to split the Guinness provided by quite possibly Europe’s
              most attentive barman, conversation quickly turned to who’d be
              wearing the Marigold in R2. My 33pts were enough to secure the
              vest. Damn, I thought, yellow and ginger don’t work.

              I recommend all future wearers of the Marigold to have packed at

              of the point. Deflated by my wardrobe malfunction caused by a
              distinct lack of self-belief and the news that Rhodes had called
              Shotgun (we have musical-taste differences), my mood is quickly
              inflated as we turned left into Rosapenna. Woah.

            <p>
              Grouped with Hugo, Rhodes and Yungy, I was first to tee off thanks
              to my new favourite piece of clothing... It quickly becomes
              apparent to all 4 of us that we could have left our drivers at
              home. This place is a playground for the stinger- if we could hit
              them, and somewhere that will punish you if you’re even a fraction
              off-line. Right from the 1st tee we found ourselves in a lunar
              landscape among gigantic dunes, each and every hole had this
              precise definition with hummocking fairways framed by them. I
              don’t think I’ve played a course where I have so often needed to
              run 30 or 40 yards ahead of my ball just to give my approach shot
              a point of reference. When you spend 4 hours in the middle of
              30ft. dunes you can easily become disorientated, but reminders
              that you’re by the sea come as you emerge around a dogleg or
              approach a plateaued green where you’re met by flashes of deep
              blues and greens. It is one of the most beautiful golf courses I
              have ever played, and I challenge anyone to say otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Rhodes’ understanding of the game helping him intelligently
              plot his way around, Youngy being the tidy golfer that he is
              meaning few dropped shots and Hugo’s course-management proving
              that he’d be a threat come Sunday, it was safe to say all 4 of us
              were going along nicely. However, evidence of this was most clear
              by the fact that Barnes, Fitz, GOAT and Mellor were- and had not
              been- sighted for the best part of an hour. Comparing our group’s
              average of 26 against their 24 might explain this to a degree but
              credit has to go to Hugo who carded 33pts around a course
              described accurately by one GolfPass reviewer as ‘a narrow,
              intimidating course designed by Pat Ruddy. Even without the rain
              and wind, I still would have shot a million.’ Too right Jason
              Deegan, too right.

              As we finished on 18 -my bag several golf balls lighter than
              earlier- we nipped into the pro-shop for some cans as the upstairs
              bar was playing host to a Wake- only in Ireland. We took our
              refreshments and sat on the bank behind the 18th green, in full
              view of the imminent approach shots, or so we thought. A
              significant portion of time passed until the sound of the boys’
              tee-shots could be heard- finally they had caught up. Two memories
              stand clear in my mind as the 4 meandered down the last fairway:
              first is the dishevelled look spread across Barnes’ face, as
              though he’d been beaten by a course which had chewed him up and
              spat him back out again. A look not too dissimilar to some of the
              people at the Wake in the clubhouse. Secondly it is Fitz saying
              with a smile on his face, “lads, I need to buy some balls before
              tomorrow.”

              As we took the obligatory team snap in front of the statue of Old
              Tom Morris, whispers of Hugo’s 33-pointer not being enough to
              de-Marigold me started to emerge. GOAT, it seemed, had risen above
              his group’s misfortunes and carded an outrageous 34 points. Fully
              deserved- the GOAT would be in yellow at Ballycastle on day 3.

              After a long day yesterday, we opt for later tee times of 3 and
              3:10pm. This is just as well as 7 of us wake up to videos of a
              Malbec-stained Mellor blasting out Sean Paul at 2:30 am, wondering
              why no-one’s joining him for the singalong. Self-explanatory, I
              think to myself. Having said our goodbyes to Rhodes whose parting
              words include plans to set up a champions dinner exclusively for
              those who have worn the Marigold (I’m still in favour of this,
              Alex get organising), we make the most of the late tee-time and go
              swimming. Looking back now, I believe the sighting of those 12
              dolphins just off the coast was an omen, a very good omen.

              With Rhodes gone it fell to Danny Kinahan (not the criminal
              mastermind behind MTK, the other one) to step in and even up the
              numbers. It’s Danny, GOAT, Mellor and I. Mellor and I very much in
              the shadow of the GOAT, were struggling to keep up- I couldn’t
              make a putt outside 1ft. and Mellor was struggling off the tee.
              I’ve not seen ball striking quite like it from an 18 handicapper,
              but I enjoyed every minute of the GOAT’s fearless strategy which
              resulted in another 30+ pointer. Those of you who know the 1st at
              Ballycastle know that staying left is key- it’s OB all down the
              right. Not the GOAT, he’s fearless and pulls driver, personifying
              the phrase ‘ignorance is bliss,’ tattoos his ball over the dogleg
              and gives himself 190 into a par 5 and the whole green to aim at.

              Although our fourball was enjoying the GOAT’S free clinic, the
              spotlight of R3 has to be placed on the group ahead of us. As
              Mellor and I approach the 2nd green we see the group ahead on the
              tee of the par 3 3rd. We hear the sort of commotion you might
              expect in 1 of every 12,500 shots on a par 3 tee-box. You know
              what’s coming. 5 minutes later as I’ve just drained my 4th 3-putt
              of the afternoon we hear an even bigger roar, “f*$king hells’ and
              “no f*&ing ways” are filling the air.{" "}

            <div className="hugo-account">

                "Due to a COVID protocol at Ballycastle, we stepped up to the
                3rd tee actually playing our 16th hole of the day. We were all
                playing ridiculously well, enjoying the sunshine and each
                other’s company. I have played Ballycastle many times in my life
                and the 3rd hole is always a charm. ’The Abbey’ as it is aptly
                named, presents a narrow par 3 with a ruinous Abbey along the
                left and a busy road along the right, with three bunkers
                guarding a largely flat and circular green. On the day it was
                playing 166 yards, a 7 iron for most of us, maybe a 9 for Fitz."
              </p>
              <p>
                "Up steps Tom Young, having a sneaky round, 7 iron in hand.
                After a couple of nifty practice swings, Youngy catches the ball
                and sends it on its way. ‘Urrghh short’ he groans. The ball
                lands an inch past the front bunker and rolls on its way and a
                silence descends as the ball rolls… and rolls… and rolls, until
                we don’t have a clear sight of it. (What complicated our view
                was the white COVID lever which surrounded the pin). A silent
                moment passes before Youngy murmurs, ‘I think that’s gone in
                boys’. Myself and Fitz erupted, running at Tom to celebrate.
                Meanwhile Dom is sprinting 100 yards towards the green to
                confirm that it had gone in. Pure elation and hands down the
                best moment I have ever experienced on a golf course. Drinks on
                Youngy."
              </p>
              <p>
                "Myself and Dom still had to try and follow it up, and thanks to
                the adrenalin rush our 7 irons went a little further than
                expected, almost onto the next tee. A triumphant moment from Tom
                Young as he carded a 1 on the inaugural La Cruche tour,
                hopefully a little sign of things ahead."

              all with 35+ points. Barnes deserves special mention here too as
              he carded a whopping 43 pointer, a +5 76 and a current La Cruche
              record. After carding in the 100s the day before, this display
              represents what we all love and hate about golf- the constant
              battle with ourselves to replicate the good and eradicate the bad.
              With the GOAT deservedly stripped of the Marigold and a midday
              tee-time for R4, it was time to celebrate Youngy’s

              Championship Sunday for all the marbles. 12 Celsius, wet, grey,
              cloudy, cold; greens slow and hairy. As you may have gathered,
              Northern Irish weather is as predictable as I am off the tee.

              In what can only be described as driving over the limit, we make
              it down the A26 just in time for our midday tee-time. Yungy’s ace
              seemingly gave everyone an excuse to drink their bodyweight in
              Smithwicks last night- that coupled with Fitz’ discovery of Baby
              Guinness. As I tee off with blurred vision and a pounding
              headache, not a care in the world about where my ball goes, I
              stripe it straight down the middle- maybe this is the way forward?
              DJ was on to something after all.

              It should be noted that written into the rules of La Cruche are
              very stringent rules on sulking. Please see our rules page for
              more details. As we make our way around a very damp Hilton it
              becomes evident to me that Mr Mellor is in danger of breaching
              this rule. It seemed that after the tough round at Rosapenna,
              Mellor no longer fancied his chances of lifting the empty jug come
              Sunday and instead turned his attention to other, fuller vessels
              of the alcoholic variety. It also seemed that the consequences of
              this 3-day binge had decided to arrive all at once, and, spurred
              on by Fitz’ and my hangover complaints his sulking intensified.
              Thankfully for him, his fantastic 15-plus ft. putt on 16
              heightened his mood significantly and forced my hand into deleting
              my message to the committee. A lesson for all of us I think.

              Sadly, we lost another member as Dom, who had a family member’s
              birthday to attend, left halfway through the round. And then there
              were six- I told you golf here was tough.

              The long course is difficult in the best of conditions, but the
              juicy rough and cold air meant getting your ball far out there was
              difficult. Our fourball averaged a score of 25 which seemed a fair
              reflection. Having played the course more times than I can count,
              I had no excuse to not post a decent score of 34pts but as the
              three of us sat around the 18th green waiting for Hugo Youngy and
              the GOAT to finish, it became known that there was a 1 point
              winning margin- not a lot when the closing hole is a par 5 and
              especially not a lot when Hugo is hitting 3 off the tee.{" "}

              As they approached the green the GOAT had all of 8ft. between him
              and eternal glory; his name up in lights; a conversation starter
              for the rest of time and the bragging rights for years to come. He
              three putts. We all seize up, not knowing what it means. Mellor
              says to me under his breath, “Is that La Cruche right there?” with
              a look of horror. Thankfully it was not, the GOAT had the shots to
              play with and played with them he did. He carded 26 points against
              Hugo’s 31 but it was enough to draw to a close a successful first
              tournament and one which was thoroughly deserved.

              Congratulations must go to Harry GOAT Rees, the winner of La
              Cruche 2020.
