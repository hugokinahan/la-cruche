            1. La Cruche will use Stableford scoring meaning EVERY putt must go

            2. Winter lies is dependent on the golf courses playing conditions

            3. In order to save time, La Cruche uses a ‘social’ alternative in
            the event of a lost of out of bounds ball; place the ball on the
            fairway or short rough adjacent to where you think the ball may have
            become lost or gone out of bounds and add a penalty stroke.
            Otherwise know as an ‘Irish drop’.
