className='review-blog-content'>\n          <p>La Cruche’s inaugural tour along the North Coast epitomised everything about what makes golf in Northern Ireland great: reasonable green fees, 40m/hr winds, horizontal rain, stunning views and a 19th hole full of Guinness. Golf here is tough.</p>\n        <div className='round-one'> \n          <h2>19th August 2020</h2>\n          <p className='italic'>The eve of the tournament. 11 Celsius, wet and grey; greens running slow.</p>\n          <p>Members Rhodes and Mellor arrived at Belfast Intl. early in the day, so Hugo and I thought it best to play a warm-up 18. With Rhodes due to leave us on Saturday- he had a family engagement, La Cruche does not operate a cutting system- he’d miss the weekend, so these swings counted. Carding 20pts at The Hilton sent a message to the rest of the field- Rhodes would be teeing off at Portrush tomorrow with the Marigold vest on.</p>\n          <p>The remaining 4 members touched down that evening and with a hybrid-loss-scare thankfully resolved at the airport we were northbound to Ballycastle, our base for the week. Excitement filled the air as there finally existed an environment where golf could be discussed in depth without the judgement of others and the focus quickly shifted to the matter at hand- Sweaty Balls (see rules).</p>\n          <h2>20th August 2020 - Round 1 - Royal Portrush Golf Club, Valley Links</h2>\n          <p className='italic'>8-18 Celsius. wet, gusty, sunny, dry and hot (Storm Ellen): greens running incredibly fast.</p>\n          <p>Youngy, Mellor, Fitz and I had the pleasure of being the second fourball. It was only right that the brainchild of La Cruche be the one to hit the first official drive of the tournament. Not the longest hitter on tour but with the 1st hole at 349 yards, size didn’t matter. Hugo ushered one down the right and his tournament was underway. Conversely if memory serves me right, Rees (henceforth referred to as the GOAT) had the misfortune of hitting his drive- also his Sweaty Ball- OB right. The only way was up for the GOAT, and up he went.</p>\n          <p>We were plotting our way very nicely around a golf course which, considering its status as Dunluce Links’ younger and less attractive brother, still holds up. Out in 17pts, I was having one of those rounds were keeping quiet is the only way to prevent the Golfing Gods from reminding you why their sport is capable of giving you an aneurysm. While Storm Ellen was intensifying the further we got from the clubhouse, a maintenance hut above the 10th green was appropriate shelter until it wasn’t- and like that Ellen’s clouds burst. Youngy didn’t lose many balls that afternoon but he did lose his umbrella- I like to think it’s made a new start somewhere in the Hebrides, Jura perhaps. As the rain lashed down, we found more robust shelter under the driving range roof and all 8 of us tried to remove our waterproofs and dry out our gloves and grips.</p>\n          <ReactPlayer\n            className='react-player'\n            url= {PRVideo}\n            width='50%'\n            height='50%'\n            controls = {true}\n\n          />\n          <span className='span-italic'>Storm Ellen in all her glory. The video still doesn’t do it justice.</span>\n          <p>One of the green-keepers must have taken pity on us- perhaps because he’d been tailing us for 3 holes and hadn’t seen a single GIR or perhaps because we were literally soaked to the bone- and offered us use of the many baskets of range balls (Titleist ProV1s no less- yes it did host The Open and yes McIlroy did miss the cut). Retrospectively, those 20 minutes spent together watching Fitz hit his SIM off the deck, discussing the course’s irrigation and surprising green speeds while freezing cold and soaked to the bone were the highlight of the trip for me. At the time it seemed a ‘snapshot’ moment but 8 months later it seems even more-so. The Golfing Gods rewarded our resolve as Ellen pushed West to annoy some other golfers, leaving behind crystal clear skies and some glorious late afternoon sunshine.</p>\n          <img alt='group' src={Image2} />\n          <span className='span-italic'>Storm Ellen in all her glory. The video still doesn’t do it justice.</span>\n          <p>The wind and the rain might have impacted the scorecards up to the 11th hole, but the soft greens left behind by Ellen gave both groups an opportunity to score some points. We averaged 25pts as a group which I think is extremely impressive. After we’d done our best to split the Guinness provided by quite possibly Europe’s most attentive barman, conversation quickly turned to who’d be wearing the Marigold in R2. My 33pts were enough to secure the vest. Damn, I thought, yellow and ginger don’t work.</p>\n          <img alt='group' src={Image1} />\n          <span className='span-italic'>Storm Ellen in all her glory.

Deflated by my wardrobe malfunction caused by a distinct lack of self-belief and the news that Rhodes had called Shotgun (we have musical-taste differences), my mood is quickly inflated as we turned left into Rosapenna. Woah.</p>\n          <img alt='group' src={Image4} />\n          <span className='span-italic'>Storm Ellen in all her glory. The video still doesn’t do it justice.</span>\n          <p>Grouped with Hugo, Rhodes and Yungy, I was first to tee off thanks to my new favourite piece of clothing... It quickly becomes apparent to all 4 of us that we could have left our drivers at home. This place is a playground for the stinger- if we could hit them, and somewhere that will punish you if you’re even a fraction off-line. Right from the 1st tee we found ourselves in a lunar landscape among gigantic dunes, each and every hole had this precise definition with hummocking fairways framed by them. I don’t think I’ve played a course where I have so often needed to run 30 or 40 yards ahead of my ball just to give my approach shot a point of reference. When you spend 4 hours in the middle of 30ft. dunes you can easily become disorientated, but reminders that you’re by the sea come as you emerge around a dogleg or approach a plateaued green where you’re met by flashes of deep blues and greens. It is one of the most beautiful golf courses I have ever played, and I challenge anyone to say otherwise.</p>\n          <p>With Rhodes’ understanding of the game helping him intelligently plot his way around, Youngy being the tidy golfer that he is meaning few dropped shots and Hugo’s course-management proving that he’d be a threat come Sunday, it was safe to say all 4 of us were going along nicely. However, evidence of this was most clear by the fact that Barnes, Fitz, GOAT and Mellor were- and had not been- sighted for the best part of an hour. Comparing our group’s average of 26 against their 24 might explain this to a degree but credit has to go to Hugo who carded 33pts around a course described accurately by one GolfPass reviewer as ‘a narrow, intimidating course designed by Pat Ruddy. Even without the rain and wind, I still would have shot a million.’ Too right Jason Deegan, too right.</p>\n          <img alt='group' src={Image5} />\n          <p>As we finished on 18 -my bag several golf balls lighter than earlier- we nipped into the pro-shop for some cans as the upstairs bar was playing host to a Wake- only in Ireland. We took our refreshments and sat on the bank behind the 18th green, in full view of the imminent approach shots, or so we thought. A significant portion of time passed until the sound of the boys’ tee-shots could be heard- finally they had caught up. Two memories stand clear in my mind as the 4 meandered down the last fairway: first is the dishevelled look spread across Barnes’ face, as though he’d been beaten by a course which had chewed him up and spat him back out again. A look not too dissimilar to some of the people at the Wake in the clubhouse. Secondly it is Fitz saying with a smile on his face, “lads, I need to buy some balls before tomorrow.”</p>\n          <img alt='group' src={Image3} />\n          <p>As we took the obligatory team snap in front of the statue of Old Tom Morris, whispers of Hugo’s 33-pointer not being enough to de-Marigold me started to emerge. GOAT, it seemed, had risen above his group’s misfortunes and carded an outrageous 34 points. Fully deserved- the GOAT would be in yellow at Ballycastle on day 3. Bravo.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div className='round-three'> \n          <h2>22nd August 2020 - Round 3 - Ballycastle Golf Club</h2>\n          <p className='italic'>18 Celsius, sunny, cloudy intervals, dry; greens firm and fast.</p>\n          <p>After a long day yesterday, we opt for later tee times of 3 and 3:10pm. This is just as well as 7 of us wake up to videos of a Malbec-stained Mellor blasting out Sean Paul at 2:30 am, wondering why no-one’s joining him for the singalong. Self-explanatory, I think to myself. Having said our goodbyes to Rhodes whose parting words include plans to set up a champions dinner exclusively for those who have worn the Marigold (I’m still in favour of this, Alex get organising), we make the most of the late tee-time and go swimming. Looking back now, I believe the sighting of those 12 dolphins just off the coast was an omen, a very good omen.</p>\n          <img alt='group' src={Image6} />\n          <p>With Rhodes gone it fell to Danny Kinahan (not the criminal mastermind behind MTK, the other one) to step in and even up the numbers. It’s Danny, GOAT, Mellor and I. Mellor and I very much in the shadow of the GOAT, were struggling to keep up- I couldn’t make a putt outside 1ft. and Mellor was struggling off the tee. I’ve not seen ball striking quite like it from an 18 handicapper, but I enjoyed every minute of the GOAT’s fearless strategy which resulted in another 30+ pointer. Those of you who know the 1st at Ballycastle know that saying left is key- it’s OB all down the right. Not the GOAT, he’s fearless and pulls driver, personifying the phrase ‘ignorance is bliss,’ tattoos his ball over the dogleg and gives himself 190 into a par 5 and the whole green to aim at. Huevos.</p>\n          <img alt='group' src={Image8} />\n          <p>Although our fourball was enjoying the GOAT’S free clinic, the spotlight of R3 has to be placed on the group ahead of us. As Mellor and I approach the 2nd green we see the group ahead on the tee of the par 3 3rd. We hear the sort of commotion you might expect in 1 of every 12,500 shots on a par 3 tee-box. You know what’s coming. 5 minutes later as I’ve just drained my 4th 3-putt of the afternoon we hear an even bigger roar, “f*$king hells’ and “no f*&ing ways” are filling the air. </p>\n          <p>The following is an account of eye-witness Hugo who observed first-hand something we all wish we’d done:</p>\n          <div className='hugo-account'>\n          <p>\"Due to a COVID protocol at Ballycastle, we stepped up to the 3rd tee actually playing our 16th hole of the day. We were all playing ridiculously well, enjoying the sunshine and each other’s company. I have played Ballycastle many times in my life and the 3rd hole is always a charm. ’The Abbey’ as it is aptly named, presents a narrow par 3 with a ruinous Abbey along the left and a busy road along the right, with three bunkers guarding a largely flat and circular green. On the day it was playing 166 yards, a 7 iron for most of us, maybe a 9 for Fitz.\"</p>\n          <p>\"Up steps Tom Young, having a sneaky round, 7 iron in hand. After a couple of nifty practice swings, Youngy catches the ball and sends it on its way. ‘Urrghh short’ he groans. The ball lands an inch past the front bunker and rolls on its way and a silence descends as the ball rolls… and rolls… and rolls, until we don’t have a clear sight of it. (What complicated our view was the white COVID lever which surrounded the pin). A silent moment passes before Youngy murmurs, ‘I think that’s gone in boys’. Myself and Fitz erupted, running at Tom to celebrate. Meanwhile Dom is sprinting 100 yards towards the green to confirm that it had gone in. Pure elation and hands down the best moment I have ever experienced on a golf course. Drinks on Youngy.\"</p>\n          <p>\"Myself and Dom still had to try and follow it up, and thanks to the adrenalin rush our 7 irons went a little further than expected, almost onto the next tee. A triumphant moment from Tom Young as he carded a 1 on the inaugural La Cruche tour, hopefully a little sign of things ahead.\"</p>\n          </div>\n          <img alt='group' src={Image7} />\n          <p>If an ace wasn’t enough, the group ahead of us produced 4 cards all with 35+ points. Barnes deserves special mention here too as he carded a whopping 43 pointer, a +5 76 and a current La Cruche record. After carding in the 100s the day before, this display represents what we all love and hate about golf- the constant battle with ourselves to replicate the good and eradicate the bad. With the GOAT deservedly stripped of the Marigold and a midday tee-time for R4, it was time to celebrate Youngy’s once-in-a-lifetime moment- he’s paying of course.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div className='round-four'> \n          <h2>23rd August 2020 - Round 4 - Hilton Templepatrick Golf & Country Club</h2>\n          <p className='italic'>Championship Sunday for all the marbles. 12 Celsius, wet, grey, cloudy, cold; greens slow and hairy. As you may have gathered, Northern Irish weather is as predictable as I am off the tee.</p>\n          <p>In what can only be described as driving over the limit, we make it down the A26 just in time for our midday tee-time. Yungy’s ace seemingly gave everyone an excuse to drink their bodyweight in Smithwicks last night- that coupled with Fitz’ discovery of Baby Guinness. As I tee off with blurred vision and a pounding headache, not a care in the world about where my ball goes, I stripe it straight down the middle- maybe this is the way forward? DJ was on to something after all.</p>\n          <p>It should be noted that written into the rules of La Cruche are very stringent rules on sulking. Please see our rules page for more details. As we make our way around a very damp Hilton it becomes evident to me that Mr Mellor is in danger of breaching this rule. It seemed that after the tough round at Rosapenna, Mellor no longer fancied his chances of lifting the empty jug come Sunday and instead turned his attention to other, fuller vessels of the alcoholic variety. It also seemed that the consequences of this 3-day binge had decided to arrive all at once, and, spurred on by Fitz’ and my hangover complaints his sulking intensified. Thankfully for him, his fantastic 15-plus ft. putt on 16 heightened his mood significantly and forced my hand into deleting my message to the committee. A lesson for all of us I think.</p>\n          <p>Sadly, we lost another member as Dom, who had a family member’s birthday to attend, left halfway through the round. And then there were six- I told you golf here was tough.</p>\n          <p>The long course is difficult in the best of conditions, but the juicy rough and cold air meant getting your ball far out there was difficult. Our fourball averaged a score of 25 which seemed a fair reflection. Having played the course more times than I can count, I had no excuse to not post a decent score of 34pts but as the three of us sat around the 18th green waiting for Hugo Youngy and the GOAT to finish, it became known that there was a 1 point winning margin- not a lot when the closing hole is a par 5 and especially not a lot when Hugo is hitting 3 off the tee. </p>\n          <p>As they approached the green the GOAT had all of 8ft. between him and eternal glory; his name up in lights; a conversation starter for the rest of time and the bragging rights for years to come. He three putts. We all seize up, not knowing what it means. Mellor says to me under his breath, “Is that La Cruche right there?” with a look of horror. Thankfully it was not, the GOAT had the shots to play with and played with them he did. He carded 26 points against Hugo’s 31 but it was enough to draw to a close a successful first tournament and one which was thoroughly deserved.</p>\n          <p>Congratulations must go to Harry GOAT Rees, the winner of La Cruche 2020.</p>\n          <img alt='group' src={Image9} />\n        </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Review2020"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
