It seemed Storm Ellen was intensifying the further we got from the clubhouse and a maintenance hut above the 10th green was appropriate shelter until Ellen’s clouds burst. Yungy didn’t lose many balls that afternoon but he lost his umbrella- I reckon it’s made a new start somewhere in the Hebrides. As the rain lashed down, we found more robust shelter under the driving range roof as all 8 of us tried to remove our waterproofs and dry out our gloves and grips.</p>\n          <p>One of the greens keepers must have taken pity on us- perhaps because he’d been on our tail for 3 holes and hadn’t seen a single GIR from one of us or perhaps because we were literally soaked to the bone- and offered us use of the many baskets of range balls (Titleist ProV1, I must add). Retrospectively, those 20 minutes spent together watching Fitz hit his SIM off the deck, discussing the course’s irrigation and the surprising speed of the greens while freezing cold, soaked to the bone were a serious highlight of the entire trip for me. The Golfing Gods rewarded our resolve as Ellen pushed West to annoy some other golfers, leaving behind crystal clear skies and some glorious late afternoon sunshine.</p>\n          <p>The wind and the rain might have impacted the scorecards up to the 11th hole, but the soft greens left behind by Ellen gave both groups an opportunity to score some points. We averaged 25pts as a group which I think is extremely impressive. After we’d done our best the split the Guinness provided by quite possibly Europe’s most attentive barman, conversation quickly turned to who’d be wearing the Marigold in R2. My 33pts were enough to secure the vest. Damn, I thought, yellow and ginger don’t work.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div className='round-two'> \n          <h2>21st August 2020 - Round 2 - Rosapenna Golf Club, Sandy Hills Links</h2>\n          <p>17 Celsius, sunny, windy, showery; greens very firm, rough very horrible- contact Dom Barnes for more details. </p>\n          <p>I recommend all future wearers of the Marigold to have packed at least one shirt that matches, hard I know but that’s sort of the point. Deflated by my wardrobe malfunction caused by a distinct lack of self-belief and the news that Rhodes has called Shotgun (we have musical-taste differences), my mood is quickly inflated as we turned left into Rosapenna. Woah.</p>\n          <p>Grouped with Hugo, Rhodes and Yungy, I was first to tee off first thanks to my new favourite piece of clothing... It quickly becomes apparent to all four of us that we could have left our drivers at home. This place is a playground for the stinger- if we could hit them and somewhere that will punish you if you’re even a fraction off-line. Right from the 1st tee we found ourselves in a lunar landscape among gigantic dunes, each and every hole had this precise definition with hummocking fairways framed by them. I don’t think I’ve played a course where I have so often needed to run 30 or 40 yards ahead of my ball just to give my approach shot a point of reference. When you spend 4 hours in the middle of 30ft. dunes you can easily become disorientated, but reminders that you’re by the sea come as you emerge around a dogleg or approach a plateaued green where you’re met by flashes of deep blues and greens. It is one of the most beautiful golf courses I have ever played, and I challenge anyone to say otherwise.</p>\n          <p>With Rhodes’ understanding of the game helping him intelligently plot his way around the course, Yungy being the tidy golfer that he is meaning few shots were being dropped and Hugo’s course-management proving that he was a threat come Sunday, it was safe to say all four of us were going along nicely. However, evidence of this was most clear by the fact that Barnes, Fitz, GOAT and Mellor were- and had not been- sighted for the best part of an hour.  Comparing our group’s average of 26 against theirs at 24 might explain this to a degree but credit has to go to Hugo who carded 33pts around a course described accurately by one GolfPass reviewer as ‘a narrow, intimidating course designed by Pat Ruddy. Even without the rain and wind, I still would have shot a million.’ Too right Jason Deegan, too right.</p>\n          <p>As we finished on 18 -my bag several golf balls lighter than the morning- we nipped into the pro-shop for some cans as the upstairs bar was playing host to a Wake- only in Ireland. We took our refreshments and sat on the bank behind the green, in full view of the approach shots that would surely be imminent. A significant portion of time passed until the sound of the boys’ tee-shots could be heard- finally they had caught up. Two memories stand clear in my mind as the 4 meandered around the dogleg: The first is the dishevelled look spread across Barnes’ face, as though he’d been beaten by a course which had chewed him up and spat him back out again. A look not too dissimilar to some of the people at the Wake behind us.

This is just as well as 7 of us wake up to videos of a Malbec-stained Mellor blasting out Sean Paul at 2:30 am, wondering why no-one’s joining him for the singalong. Self-explanatory, I think. Having said our goodbyes to Rhodes whose parting words include plans to set up a champions dinner exclusively for those who have worn the Marigold (I’m all for this by the way), we make the most of the late tee-time and go swimming. Looking back now, I believe the sighting of those 12 or dolphins just off the coast was an omen, a good one.</p>\n          <p>Grouped with Hugo, Rhodes and Yungy, I was first to tee off first thanks to my new favourite piece of clothing...
